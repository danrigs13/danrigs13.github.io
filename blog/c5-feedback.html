      Pairing with people during DBC has been so much more fun and interactive than other group projects/assignments in my other schooling experiences. Here it doesn't feel like you have one or two people that head everything up while the other just sits there and is carried by the other two. It is truly a cooperative effort to get everything finished correctly and prettily. I really enjoy pairing because of this fact. I have never felt belittled or berated by a pair or a moderator, and it has truly helped me learn the material faster. The fun parts of it would be getting the other person's perspective on the challenge and getting to listen to how someone else's brain works. We get so used to listening to our own voice and how our brain works that sometimes it gets stagnant, and it is so useful to get another voice up there to shake things up. The difficult part can also come into play here, also. While working alone, you don't have to verbalize your thought process. When you work with a pair, you have to articulate what you're thinking as you're thinking it, so it can get a little more difficult. The other difficulty that I have had is trying to go a little too fast and not slowing down enough to read the information that I need to read before jumping into a challenge.

      I feel very blessed as far as my feedback goes. I got wonderfully kind reviews that have helped my self esteem enormously. I was afraid that I seemed like I had no idea what I was doing and that I was bringing the pair down/slowing us, but it turns out my pairs have not felt this way about me. That is probably the best thing to come from feedback for me. It has helped me to see that I'm not behind like I thought I was and that everyone else is having the same problems and questions that I have. This has definitely helped me be more confident in my code writing, which has made me feel not so beaten down by it. I am able to look at my code with a renewed fervor and energy that I was starting to lose before the feedback came in. I am definitely going to continue to be open to new ideas, because I know that I do NOT know everything that there is to know about ruby. Also, I am going to read more of the books in order to gain as much knowledge as I can, but not read so much that I get overwhelmed. Small chunks is the best way for me to go, so I hope to be able to implement that in my study habits.

      Writing feedback was very interesting. It forced me to take note of particularly good things that my partner did. I was able to remember things specifically for my feedback, and I tried to focus on the positive things. The hardest thing so far has been to find something constructive for them to take action on. Thus far, my pairs have all been very considerate and knowledgable, so I have had no real negative interaction with anyone. There has been someone that talked a little too fast, and someone else that had somewhat distracting background noise, but those are really my only two complaints/comments about my pairs. I have really enjoyed getting to know the other people in my cohort and getting to chat with them about everyday things aside from the challenges that we are working on. I really enjoy the feedback process; I appreciate the fact that our feedback has to be reviewed before it is given to us. I think this really makes people think about exactly what they are saying in their feedback so that they don't accidentally come across as rude or abrupt.
