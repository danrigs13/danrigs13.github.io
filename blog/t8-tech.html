      Alrighty, today we're going to be looking at functional programming. There are two components that are essential to understanding and running functional programming. First off, your data should be immutable (unchanging), and stateless (or the program only knows what is currently being passed through it).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that our data be immutable because then the computer has to do less work when running the programs. It will create new sets of data based on the changes that you have programmed into your old data. We can write functions in the program that will add the two sets together and eliminate duplications, essentially leaving you with one set of updated data, but by doing it in this manner, we have decreased the 'think-time' of your program. This is very helpful with the fact that our programs are also stateless. They are not biased or swayed because of previous data that has been passed through them, they will run true to the parameters set and only look at what they are being given as they run.

      You could imagine that these two components can be helpful but can also cost you a lot of space when it comes to being repetitive and copying data over and over. This is where coders get to be creative and solve part of this problem with the code that they write. You can write code that compiles your new data, reduces recursion, and is very efficient, and that will help your program run smoothly. If this is done in an effective manner, the speed and output of your programs should be true to the calculations and not slow the program at all. This is very important, though. It would be easy to have your program output a greater number of lines than it can handle if these guidelines are not met. Creative coding is a great way to solve this.
