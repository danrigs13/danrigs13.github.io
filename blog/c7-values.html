      I agree with Claude Steele about affirmation being the best combatant to  stereotype threat. I have always had a really strong sense of self and have never been easily intimidated by situations or other people, but that's probably because I have had such wonderful role models. I know role models aren't exactly what they mean by affirmation, but in a way they are exactly what affirmation means. They are people that you can relate to (so they are inherently similar to you in some form or fashion), and they have qualities or abilities that you aspire to have.

      I tend to see that I am happiest when I am achieving a goal. Whether it's a personal goal, career related, or otherwise, goals and achievements make me happy. They help me know that I am on the right path and that I am doing well. The achievements are even more important when they are related to me being self sufficient and doing something that means something. Being promoted at work is always a great feeling and I generally look forward to having new responsibilities and tasks that come with it. When I volunteer and help other people, I get this awesome warm and fuzzy feeling that makes my day better no matter what. I can honestly say that making other people happy makes me really happy. If I can get one person to smile in a day that might be a horrible day for me, then I feel like I have accomplished something.

       In general, I would say that I try to live up to these values as often as I can, so they would all get either a 4 or a 5. I say 4 because I don't always manage it, but I do try. The last time someone asked me advice, it was in relation to a person's relationship. They were asking how they should respond to a friend's breakup. I think it definitely falls into the meaningful work value. It doesn't always have to be things like saving the rainforest, meaningful work just means making something meaninful to one person.

      When I think about my values, I feel very proud. I think I have a good set of values that has lead me to make fairly good decisions throughout my life. I also think that they help me manage stereotype threat very well. I don't get angry very quickly, so if I feel threatened I'm more likely to walk away than 'do' anything about it. I am pretty strong willed as it is, so it takes a lot to shake me and it has definitely come in handy in the past. I used to be a bartender, so beligerant, ignorant nonsense tends to go in one ear and out the other. Other things that I will do to keep me in good spirits would probably be calling my best friends from home. I just moved here from Texas and I miss everyone a bunch, so talking to them regularly definitely helps me smile more.
