      First off, hello! Thank you for reading this, and I'm sorry if it's terrible. The fun thing is, you can walk away if you want to, YAY! Hopefully you don't, though, because that would make me sad. Question number one, two, and three that I will attempt to answer today are as follows; what are the benefits of version control, how does git help you keep track of changes, why use GitHub to store your code? I'm so glad you asked! Version control is this awesome tool that would be very handy in a writing class. Possibly even, a coding class *gasp*. Let's start with a basic analogy. If you have an English paper that you are trying to write, and you go through your writing process of outline, rough draft, revised draft 1, revised draft 2, revised draft 3, and on arriving at your final draft, you suddenly realize that there was a part of revised draft 2 you wanted to keep, it is no longer then end of the world. You don't have to wrack your brain for the magical paragraph you so recklessly deleted and are subsequently hating yourself over. If you use version control, you will have a copy of your outline, rough draft, revised drafts 1, 2, and 3, AND your final copy. Now, all you have to do is open up revised draft 2 and pull out that literary masterpiece of a paragraph and put it in your final copy!

        Where is this magical tool that will help you gain your sanity? It's used in a number of places, but most notably it's in use at GitHub. Once you have your repository cloned onto your computer, you simply commit your changes and push them to GitHub. Committing is not necessarily long term, so don't get all weird about it, ok? Just commit your changes to your code or file as you go and you will have a copy of your work with the incremental changes that you are making. The biggest suggestion on this one is; save early, save often!

        GitHub is useful for more than just version control, though. This is a website where you can share your code with as few or as many people as you like. There can be 100 people working on a program, debugging it, creating new features, or just making it more awesome all around. Your code is already fabulous, but let's make it even more so.
