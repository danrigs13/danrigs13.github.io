  <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

    <p>
      Well, as the title states, I have an Abstract Random style of thinking. I used to think I was a more concrete person, but now that I have taken this test (and read the summaries of the other thinking styles), I would have to agree with the AR status I have been given. I feel really lucky to have found this program with the thinking style that I have, because I feel like that's exactly what it is designed for. I know that it isn't  ONLY for AR thinkers, but it seems like the DBC environment allows AR thinkers to flourish quite well.

    <p>
      The issue that I can see with being AR is that we don't necessarily think in a linear fashion. So all of the step 1, step 2, step 3, etc., assignments do tend to get a little boring. I think I have learned how to follow step by step instructions pretty well, since I was in college and basically had to learn how to think like the professors in order to pass. That is probably the biggest struggle so far, I keep going back to challenges that I thought I had completed, only to realize that they were half finished, and I think it's partly because of how I think and partly because I tend to try moving onto something else when I get frustrated (which happens a lot).

      Another thing that tends to be an issue for AR people, according to Gregorc, is accepting criticism, even if it's positive. I definitely struggle with that in my day to day life, and I can't even imagine how hard it's going to be for me once we hit the on-site portion of DBC. I think I'll just need to try taking everything with a grain of salt and use the criticism instead of being upset by it. In my last job, my boss criticized every little thing I did, and there were points I had to walk away from him so I didn't cry, and I don't want that to be what happens every time someone says something to me. I desperately want to get better at that, I don't like that my emotions can run away with me like that.

    <p>When it comes to mindset, I definitely want to be in the growth category. I know a lot of people that are in the fixed mindset and I feel sorry for them sometimes. Other times I want to hit them in the head with a big rock, but that's a different story. I don't want someone to think about me that way, though, and I think that going through DBC is really going to help me with that. I know that I know nothing about all of this, and that's OK! I'm learning something incredibly new and different from ANYTHING I have ever done, but I'm learning ways to apply the strategies and styles I already know to the materials here at DBC in order to help me learn this quickly.
