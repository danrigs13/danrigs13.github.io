  <h2>How To Ask Them</h2>

      Learning how to ask a question is really important to help you get a quick and accurate answer. If you don't know what you're trying to ask, then how could you expect someone to help you with an answer? My parents taught me that when I was younger, and it has held true my whole life. The whole key to good questions is knowing what you are trying to ask before you try to ask it.

      The most common mistake that I see on the internet when people ask questions is that they are not specific enough. There are a lot of people that will ask very vague, general questions that people can't answer. The most successful questions are ones that are pin-point specific and clearly outline their problems. For example, you can't really just ask someone, "Hey, can you tell me how people are made?" That answer takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 4 years, depending on the person's sarcasm and education levels. You can, however, ask someone, "What are the stages of meiosis?", because that is a fairly specific question that relates to how people are 'made'.

      The second most common mistake I see is when people are trying to ask a very specific question, but they ramble on and on to try to explain what they're asking. So my second suggestion for good questions is to be concise. If you start asking a question and half-way through you sound like you're trying to give directions in the south (i.e., you go down about 2 miles until you get to the barn that isn't there anymore but you can still see part of the west wall because it's propped up against that big oak tree that Sally's father almost fell out of last hunting season), do everyone a favor and just stop for a minute to collect your thoughts. Those are my two thoughts on how to ask good questions, be specific and concise.
