  <h2>Where can I belong?</h2>

        I have definitely felt the impact of stereotype threat. When I was in college, I was a Biomedical Sciences major to start off with, and that is a predominately male field. However, since Vet school, which was my ultimate goal, is predominately women, I didn't actually feel the stereotype threat there. I felt very comfortable in my science classes and I now feel more fortunate for having felt that way. Where I have felt it was more in my previous job experiences.

       I'm a 5'2" female, so I am not an intimidating figure at all, but I have worked with livestock ever since I was in high school. I started off in FFA with hogs and goats, and always felt very comfortable and safe there because there was a pretty fair mix of male and female students. I then began working at a cattle auction barn, running cattle during sales and loading trailers, etc. So there was a lot of, "Oh let me do that for you, you can't reach/aren't strong enough/blah blah blah." I think the thing that saved me, though, was my stubbornness. Instead of letting things like that get to me, I would just do whatever it was they thought I couldn't do. That also made me more inclined to take the tougher loading jobs or be the first one to offer to stay late/come in early. I felt the need to prove myself even more than anyone else because I was the only one there that wasn't a guy.

      If I were able to talk to someone else in a similar situation, I would say that if they looked up similar, prominent people in their field, that could help them feel more secure. By seeing that other people who are the same type of "different" as you are can be successful and respected, you can feel less like an outsider and it will give you a better sense of belonging. For me, Temple Grandin was a really good role model to look up to. Also, there were a few female members of the community that owned/raised livestock that I was able to talk to. Whether it's looking up the details of someone or finding someone that you can talk to in person, just having a person can make a world of difference.
