      Well, either you liked the first one enough to come back, or you just don't learn. Either way, your poor judgment is working well for me! After watching the video, the main thing that stood out to me was the two fears that he was talking about. I definitely fall into the first category that he mentioned. I am from a teeny tiny town in Central Texas and I have absolutely no prior experience with coding whatsoever. I worked with animals basically my whole life. Definitely my whole life if you count drunk people, because I was a bartender for a while.

        So far, though, I think I'm really going to get on pretty well with the teaching style. I like the way that we are learning in this first week and I really can't wait to get on with more of it. I LOVE the fact that it's an experimental program. I feel like it is much more open to change and new ideas than the traditional education I have had my entire life. I also really like that none of the material has seemed condescending thus far. Even on the most basic of elements, it has been a genuine learning experience.
