  <h1>Don't Push My Dog<span>April 19, 2015</span></h1>
  <h2>**Psycho noises**</h2>

    <p>
      I was spending time today with a group of my aunt's friends. While I know some of them, there was a large portion of people that I don't know; they are all older and are generally pretty easy to get along with and entertaining. I had my dog, Daisy, with me. She is a bloodhound and is still only a year and a half old, so she gets wound up pretty easily. There was a man that brought over his daughter (about 14 years old), and his son (about 2 years old). One of the other people had brought their chihuahua, and it got very yappy at the little boy and was being a bit mean but hadn't made contact or gone after him in any way. This all happened about 8 feet away from Daisy and I, but this lady sitting to my left stuck her foot out in front of my dog and asked how she was with children. I admitted that she really just isn't sure what children are and I was holding her leash very tightly and only gave her about 6" of wiggle room because of that. The lady then tried to push Daisy back with her foot and said, "well, we should keep her back over there away from him so that she doesn't hurt him." This really irritated me and I got a bit snippy when I told her, "I know how my dog acts and that is why I am holding her over here, I have it handled just fine." She then went back to ignoring me.

      I understand that she was just trying to look out for the little boy, and if I could go back and do it again, I would probably just sit my dog a little farther away from the woman so that she could not touch Daisy. At first, I was just insulted that this woman assumed 1-I could not handle my own dog, 2-I did not care enough to keep the child safe, 3-That I needed to be told exactly what to do in this situation because I would not be able to figure it out on my own, and 4-She pushed my dog. After I thought about it, I realized that it was the way she said what she said that really got to me, and the first 3 of those reasons I just listed really didn't help matters. The fourth reason I listed just made me mad all on its own; it is rude to push a complete stranger's dog around with your foot, and it's something that I would never dream of doing except under extreme circumstances.

      As far as a resolution to the conflict, it was not the 'nicest' 30 seconds of my life, but it also wasn't a huge public fit. I'm honestly not even sure she is aware that she irritated me. I just let it go, which was easy enough since she was ignoring me beforehand. She went back to her conversation on the other side and I resumed mine with my aunt. I learned that it's easiest to just let some things go a long time ago, and this experience just reinforced that. I could have made a big deal about her pushing my dog away and snapped at her about being rude and assuming that I couldn't handle things on my own, but I didn't. I chose to be a little snippy with my words (which I really should have thought better of), but other than that I didn't react to her.
