  <h2>Arrays vs Hashes</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
      Arrays contain raw data, where hashes contain raw data plus a relationship between the data and a key.You can think of it like grades in a class. An array can contain all of your personal grades, or all of the grades made by all of the students. It cannot, however, differentiate between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say you are in college, and in Intro to Rainbows, you have made the following grades: 72, 89, and 76. An array for you would be my_grades = [72, 89, 76]. If we look at the whole class, which consists of you (Rapunzel, just to make things easy), Ariel, Jasmine, and Cinderella, we might find the following grades: 72, 89, 76, 85, 90, 83, 87, 88, 92, 78, 67, 88. An array for the whole class would look like this: class_grades = [72, 89, 76, 85, 90, 83, 87, 88, 92, 78, 67, 89]. Arrays can be useful for things like this, because they are able to store lots of data. Obviously we cannot tell which grades belong to which princess, which demonstrates the limitation of arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
       Hashes have their own limitations, though. Hashes are able to contain pairs of information. So we could create a hash of you and your classmates, plus each of your average grades in the class. It might look like this:
    </p>
    <p>class = { </p>
    <p>  Ariel => 86 </p>
    <p>  Cinderella => 78 </p>
    <p>  Jasmine => 89 </p>
    <p>  Rapunzel => 79 </p>
    <p>}</p>

    <p>So, we can see that they each have their advanatages and disadvantages. Arrays can contain more data points, but it's harder to compare things with them. Hashes can contain only pairs, but they can contain as many pairs as you would like. Each pair has both a key (i.e. Ariel), and a value (i.e. 86), and we are able to call up that value at any point by simply calling on the key.
