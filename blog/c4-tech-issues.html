      One of the things that I originally think of when given this topic is the stereotype that tech people have against them. When I first started thinking of computer coding, the image that came to mind was one of people that are pale as ghosts in a basement somewhere, that can't talk to "non-tech" people, and that probably live with their mothers because of a crippling fear of society and sunlight. Being someone that loves being outdoors and has never met a stranger, I quickly dismissed the idea of being a coder.

      I am quickly coming to terms with the fact that coders are normal people, with a very slight emphasis on "normal". If I had this outlook when I was in high school and going to college, I don't think that I would have changed my major, but I might have gotten into coding much faster. There is still the stigma against being in tech. I think if we could help everyone understand that coders are just regular people that are able to build really cool stuff that you just can't see, it would really help the tech world.

      There is a HUGE deficit of coders/programmers, and I think it may be due, in part, to this stigma. Particularly when it comes to women. Coding isn't sexy or feminine. It's a very male driven world, and I think that this fact is already starting to change, but there is a long way to go. Creating programs for high school girls to get them interested in coding (while not ONLY marketing them towards the "smart" girls) could really help with this. It will take a long time, if ever, for women to equal men in the industry, but this is a start. We may not see a lot of change right away, but the long term gains could be incredible.
